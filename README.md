# NodeJs-practiceCodes
Welcome to my NodeJs-practiceCodes repository! This GitHub repo contains my practice codes during learning nodeJs from 'proAcademy'.
You will find my practice codes for Core Modules and Common APIs, Express.js, Authentication and Authorization, Async programming, middlewares and database(mongodb) and much more.

 
 ## Introduction
 
This GitHub repository documents my journey of learning Nodejs through the comprehensive course on 'proacademy' youtube channel.
Here, I share my practice codes, projects, and experiments as I dive into the world of Node.js. 
This repository serves as a personal record of my progress, showcasing the solutions I developed during the course to strengthen my understanding
of Nodejs principles and best practices. You will find my practice codes for Core Modules and Common APIs, Express.js, Authentication and Authorization, 
Async programming, middlewares and database(mongodb) and much more. I have delved deep into these concepts 
to gain hands-on experience. All the codes neat and are written in well organized manner.

## Features
The repository includes:

- **Core Modules and Common APIs**: Exploring the foundational aspects of Node.js with a focus on its built-in modules and common APIs. I'll be experimenting 
                                  with functionalities such as the File System (fs), HTTP, Events, and more.

- **Express.js:** Witnessing the power of Express.js as I build web applications and RESTful APIs using this popular Node.js framework. 
                From routing to middleware, expect a wide range of Express.js exploration.

- **Authentication and Authorization:** Unrevealing the secrets of secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms. I'll delve into techniques using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) etc.

- **Asynchronous and Synchronous Programming:** Embracing the asynchronous nature of Node.js through practical examples. I'll be showcasing Promises, Async/Await, and classic callback patterns.

- **Middleware and Database (MongoDB)**: Discovering the significance of middleware in Express.js applications and how it enables seamless request processing. 
                                      Additionally, we'll integrate with MongoDB, a powerful NoSQL database.

...and much more!
