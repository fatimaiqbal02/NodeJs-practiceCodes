# NodeJsWithExpressJs
Welcome to the **NodejsWithExpressJs** directory. This directory contains my practice codes for learning nodejs with expressJS during learning complete nodeJs from 'proAcademy'.

 ## Introduction
 
This directory documents my journey of learning ExpressJS (a popular web application framework for Node.js) through the comprehensive course on 'proacademy' youtube channel.
Here, I share my practice codes, projects, and experiments as I dive into the world of ExpressJS. 
This repository serves as a personal record of my progress, showcasing the solutions I developed during the course to strengthen my understanding
of ExpressJS principles and best practices.
You will find my practice codes for including synchronous and asynchronous programming, callbacks and promises, Core modules, working with APIs, 
handling packages, utilizing the URL and HTTP modules, file system operations, event-driven architecture, routing, and creating servers.
All the codes neat and are written in well organized manner.

## Features
The directory includes:

- **Understanding REST Architecture:** Learning about the principles and concepts behind the REST architecture, which serves as a foundation for building modern web APIs.
- **Working with Express.js Basics:** Learning basics of Express.js, including setting up a server, handling routes, and managing requests and responses.
- **Handling GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE Requests:** Exploring how to handle different types of HTTP requests using Express.js, including GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE, to build dynamic web applications with or without by using route handler functions.
- **Middleware in Express.js:** Understanding the concept of middleware in Express.js and how it allows us to add custom logic and functionalities to the application's request-response cycle.
- **Creating Custom Middleware:** Learning how to create our own custom middleware to perform specific tasks or validations for incoming requests.
- **Using Third-Party Middleware:** Discovering how to leverage third-party middleware to add advanced functionalities like authentication, logging, and more to our Express.js applications.
- **Mounting Routes in Express.js:** Learning about route organization and how to mount multiple routes within an Express.js application for better modularity and maintainability.
- **Creating and Using Routes Modules:** Diving into creating and utilizing modular route handlers to enhance the structure and organization of our Express.js application.
- **Working with Route Parameters:** Exploring how to work with dynamic route parameters, enabling you to build flexible APIs that can handle varying data.
- **Understanding Param Middleware:** Delving deeper into middleware by focusing on param middleware, which allows you to preprocess specific route parameters.
- **Chaining Multiple Middleware:** Learning how to combine multiple middleware functions in a specific order to achieve complex request processing and validation.
- **Serving Static Files:** Discovering how to serve static assets like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files using Express.js, enhancing the user experience.

...and much more!
