# NodeJs-Basics
Welcome to the **Nodejs-Basics** directory. This directory contains my practice codes for learning nodejs basics during learning complete nodeJs from 'proAcademy'.

 ## Introduction
 
This directory documents my journey of learning Nodejs-basics through the comprehensive course on 'proacademy' youtube channel.
Here, I share my practice codes, projects, and experiments as I dive into the world of Node.js. 
This repository serves as a personal record of my progress, showcasing the solutions I developed during the course to strengthen my understanding
of Nodejs principles and best practices.
You will find my practice codes for including synchronous and asynchronous programming, callbacks and promises, Core modules, working with APIs, 
handling packages, utilizing the URL and HTTP modules, file system operations, event-driven architecture, routing, and creating servers.
All the codes neat and are written in well organized manner.

## Features
The directory includes:

- **Synchronous Programming**: Learning how to work with synchronous operations in Node.js and understanding their implications on code execution.

- **Asynchronous Programming:** Delving into advanced asynchronous programming techniques to handle concurrency and asynchronous flows effectively.

- **Callbacks and Promises:** Mastering the concepts of callbacks and promises for handling asynchronous operations in Node.js.

- **Common Modules and APIs**: Exploring the commonly used modules and APIs in Node.js for tasks like file system operations, working with events, and more.

- **File System Operations:** Understanding how to perform file system operations such as reading, writing, and manipulating files using Node.js.

- **URL and HTTP Modules:** Diving into the URL and HTTP modules in Node.js to handle web requests and build web servers.

- **Creating Servers:** Building and configuring the web servers in Node.js to serve web applications and APIs.

- **Routing:** Exploring the concept of routing in the Node.js and how it can be used to handle different HTTP requests.

- **Working with Packages:** Discovering how to manage packages in Node.js using tools like npm and explore popular packages for different functionalities.

- **Creating Custom Modules:** Creating and using custom modules in Node.js to modularize your code and promote code reusability.

- **Understanding Streams:** Gaining a deep understanding of streams in Node.js for efficient handling of data and I/O operations.

- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Learning about the event-driven architecture(Event emitter, listener & handler) in Node.js and how it facilitates non-blocking I/O operations.

...and much more!
